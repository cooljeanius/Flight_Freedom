#textdomain wesnoth-Flight_Freedom

# The original author found this in their old stuff, and put this in the FtF package so curious people have a bit more background about the magi.
# It probably doesn't work with modern Wesnoth versions though.

# One more scenario was planned after this. The Magi's secret is that they have discovered how to elevate drakes to true dragons, as drakes are larval dragons that have lost their final form.
# In scenario 8b, the player would have to complete several tasks while surviving waves of humans, until the Magi can start the process and a drake can be sealed away.
# If successful, the player gets a dragon beginning with Return to Morogor.
# Another idea (scenario 8c?) was for the Magi to cause the volcano at the center of Morogor to erupt, triggering a Boatmurdered-style lava flood decimating the humans.
# Possibly the player would be able to choose 8b or 8c, with 8c ending the campaign with a pyrrhic victory (as the lava devastates the island and kills many drakes as well), and 8b continuing into the A branch and allowing for the best ending.
