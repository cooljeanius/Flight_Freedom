If we claim the island for our own, then we put our hands on a fortune's worth of their unique stone. Wizards and mages from across the land have always paid dearly for even pebbles from Morogor. If we move quickly, the only real obstacle in our way is the danger of Prax's escaped slaves returning home and raising a warning. We could never take Morogor after their defenses have been raised."
