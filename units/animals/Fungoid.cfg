    description= _ "Created by accident in the garbage can of an alchemist, fungoids are magical mushrooms that can multiply very quickly. Since they were so soft and weak, nobody in the region took the things too seriously... until a couple hundred of them showed up at the nearest town. After that, all the town's families enjoyed the weekly picnic and fungoid smashing in the nearby forest, small kids and elderly included. Eventually, the fungoids adopted the use of twigs as defensive weapons."
