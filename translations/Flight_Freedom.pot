"The requisite energies are housed in crystal orbs. They can be released into the awaiting ritual altars by even my most dim-witted assistants, merely by the simple act of breaking them.

The Engine will then release a modified teleportation charm derived from forbidden Silver lore to shunt me through the singularity into the void.\n"

If any of my assistants deign to initiate the activation sequence without my command, the Automata will reward their faithlessness with death."

"<span size='xx-large' stretch='semiexpanded'><u>The Isle of Storms</u></span>\n"
"<span size='large'><i>Mage Vonden of Aldril</i>\n"
"\n"
"The Isle of Storms is located to the west of the Southwood, approximately a quarter of the way West of the Great Continent to the Old Continent. Its geography consists primary of coastal sub-tropical low-lands, with a central mountain ridge that buffers the high-lands from the otherwise-ubiquitous southern heat. Those explorers who have managed to return describe a resource-rich and fertile land. Doubtlessly the Crown of Wesnoth would have colonized the island long ago, but for the island's many dangers.\n"
"\n"
"In the lands of the Great Continent, natural lightning only falls during thunderstorms. Not so on the Isle of Storms, as on occasion lightning strikes the ground from a clear blue sky. Worse still is that this unnatural lightning is known to at times coalesce into the elemental entities the locals term “Thunder Spirits”. These Thunder Spirits can call down lightning strikes of their own onto their unfortunate victims. None have been able to communicate with them, and they kill indiscriminately until they eventually dissipate into the air. Because of this ever-present threat, no permanent settlements have been established on the Isle. Concentrations of people seem to attract the Thunder Spirits, as attested to by the ruins dotted along the coast. Rather the locals tend to live in rude villages of wood and hides, which can be quickly rebuilt in the event of a Thunder Spirit attack.\n"
"\n"
"Making matters worse for the inhabitants, the Isle is home to several tribes of orcs. These orcs are the real masters of the Isle, and rule over the humans with an iron fist. When they are not fighting each other, they frequently seek to challenge the Thunder Spirits. Most orcs who undertake this endeavor are presumably burned to a crisp. Those few who survive are renowned for their bravery and often rise to become chieftains of their tribes.\n"
"\n"
"Surrounded by powerful ocean currents, the Isle is most notable as a maritime hazard given its many aforementioned dangers. However it remains of particular interest to wizards. The Isle is situated at the confluence of multiple ley lines, or currents of ambient magic. These currents serve to greatly lower the barriers to ritual magic. The Isle is also of interest to various pirates and criminals seeking a refuge from the Crown, most of whom fall prey to the Thunder Spirits or the orcs.\n"
"\n"
"It is regrettable that the Isle will most likely remain far from the light of civilization for the foreseeable future.</span>"

"<span size='xx-large' stretch='semiexpanded'><u>On this Laboratory</u></span>\n"
"<span size='large'>Apprentices, many of you wonder why my acquaintances have called you to venture to this remote and perilous island. To leave behind your former lives, your friends, even your families. As you will learn, there is no growth, no knowledge, without sacrifice. But to the point of this island and my grand Laboratory.\n"
"\n"
"You will, in time, come to further know of the great Engine and of the enormity of my genius. Building such a stupendous craft as the Engine here comes with several advantages. Few others can begin to comprehend the gravity of our quest, and of those who behold the slightest glimmer of my greatness the majority respond with fear. This remote island offers us security and isolation from those who would so foolishly seek to stand in our way. As a ley line nexus the island eases the practical application and investigation of magic. Even the Thunder Spirits have been made to serve us. Not only are they a powerful deterrent against any potential interloper, but by way of metal spires on the mountaintops we are able to harness the power of lightning itself to fuel our endeavors. Metal filaments have been woven into the walls of my Laboratory at regular intervals, creating a ward structure which neutralizes the energetic potential of any Thunder Spirits which attempt to manifest inside.\n"
"\n"
"Perhaps you have learned about the Gate to the east of this island, termed by the ignorant who believe it to be the source of the Thunder Spirits as the 'Gate of Storms'. A similar gate was indeed used by Lord Jeyvan during his invasion of the Green Isle. But the Gate is older than Jeyvan. The ancients who built the Gate, along with its sister on the Green Isle, once built a network of gates across all of known Irdya. Jeyvan's Lich-Lords merely discovered the gate they used to pollute the Green Isle with orcs. Today, rather few gates have survived the passages of time, let alone the ravages of wars and empires. Most of those which are left remain concealed with magics beyond the ken of the common wizards of this age.\n"
"\n"
"For my purposes, the Gate has been a valuable object of study as an example of bridging the planes. A crude microcosm of my ultimate objective, but nonetheless one which has provided many insights to the construction of the Engine. The orcs avoid the land near the Gate, which has become a testing ground for experiments too large to be conducted in the Laboratory. But know this: all of my servants are strictly forbidden from approaching the Gate without my express permission. Not only do the Thunder Spirits frequently manifest at the Gate, but the inadvertent activation of the Gate has the potential of untold consequences for the safe and efficient operation of the Engine.</span>"

"<span size='xx-large' stretch='semiexpanded'><u>Automata: Theory and Construction</u></span>\n"
"<span size='large'>The Engine shall forever be known throughout all of history. Not only as my greatest work, but as the apex of what can be accomplished by the human mind and hands. MY mind and MY hands. Yet I have produced an enormous variety of lesser wonders as well. Most awesome among these are the Automata. These serve in many ways. As manual laborers which never tire, never sleep, never cease in their labors. Laborers that can survive conditions that would break even the hardiest of my mortal servants. Also as sentinels, both to maintain security in the Laboratory and as an army should others dare to interfere with my plans.\n"
"\n"
"Two inventions reside at the core of each Automaton; the Core Praxis Unifier (CPU) and the Regulator of Arcane Magic (RAM). Many lesser wizards have learned to animate various golems and familiars. But these suffer from the limitation of being bound to the task they were created. The CPU overcomes this by incorporating a variety of Praxis Routines which I have termed Programs, each of which utilizes derivatives of golem magic to encode a particular task. By way of miniscule pathways of metal and carefully modulated pulses of lightning the CPU can load various Programs as needed. Adding and removing Programs in this way becomes simple, with no need to renew enchantments or reconstruct the Automaton in question.\n"
"\n"
"Automata require both magic and caged lightning to operate. Their magical source is derived from a bound soul, trapped in place by runes that some of the necromancers among us would find vaguely familiar. The RAM siphons energy from the soul to supply the various Programs along with a rotary magnetic armature which generates synthetic lightning. Such synthetic lightning can be far more easily channeled throughout the chassis of the Automation by way of metallic wires. When these wires are connected to another rotary magnetic armature the device functions in reverse, transforming synthetic lightning back into motion. Such armatures are built into various hard points in the chassis, and supply the Automaton with incredible amounts of motive force. All the while glyphs of holy magic sustain the strength of the empowering soul.\n"
"\n"
"The Automata represent only an infintesimal fraction of the elegance and complexity of the Engine, though are by no means simple to craft. Indeed, the first Automaton was quite difficult even for a wizard of my unparalled talents. However I had yet another revelation. Most of the complexity of an Automaton is mechanical, and hence can be built by other Automata. By grafting specialized Automata to a rolling line with each Automaton performing a single construction sub-task, a great many Automata chassis can be built in a short period of time. The soul binding ritual and glyph crafting techniques have been refined to be within the talents of a sufficiently trained wizard of mere middling skill. As for the origin of these bespoke souls, that is a lesson for another time.</span>"
