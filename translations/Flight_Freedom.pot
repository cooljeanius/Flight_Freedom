Hartholar survived for a time to become a warlord of minor repute, enjoying a brief reign of terror before a fatherless hatchling plunged a knife into his back. Though humans never again dared to invade Morogor, many drakes eventually departed the island to seek fortune elsewhere."

But all share a burning hatred for humanity and a fierce resolve to defend their homes and way of life to the end."
